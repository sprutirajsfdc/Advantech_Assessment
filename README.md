# Advantech_Assessment

Today, we need to create a survey (using LWC) to collect dietary preferences from our
Customers (Contact records). The survey will display the customer's name and inquire
Whether they are vegetarian or non-vegetarian. When a user submits the survey answers,
These answers should be updated in the Contact object. Additionally, the customer's survey
Responses should be sent to an organizer via email. Please specify a particular Contact record
For the organizer.

Please use LWC to create this survey form and embed it within the Contact Layout.
Create a field in the Contact object to store survey responses.
Is it possible to track whether organizer have opened the notification email?
Use LWC to display a list of individuals who have completed the survey within the organizers
Contact Layout.
